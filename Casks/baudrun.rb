  # Baudrun is currently shipped ad-hoc signed but not notarized
  # (no paid Apple Developer account yet — see CHANGELOG 0.9.0).
  # Without notarization, macOS Gatekeeper on Tahoe (15+) will
  # quarantine and may delete the binary on first run. Strip the
  # quarantine attribute on install so the app launches without
  # the user having to right-click → Open or run `xattr -cr` by
  # hand. Remove this once we publish notarized builds.
